# myCv

This is the code of the website <a href="http://mycv.host">mycv.host</a>
The application is built using:
- AngularJS
- Java EE 7 (WildFly)
- RESTful services
- JSON
- MongoDB
and hosted on OpenShift by RedHat
The goal is to have a CV that fit only 1 page and that can be easily printed. The html is mainly based on <div> tags and css styling.

Next steps:
- bootstrap version
- Angular 2
- multi users
